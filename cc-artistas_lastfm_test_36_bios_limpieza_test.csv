It all started with a double bass player, a guitarist and a violinist; all highly talented musicians who are really into swing, Django addicts who enjoy tinkering with electro. Their project swayed a singer, a clarinettist, a trombonist who doubles up on percussion and a guitarist who also acts as DJ. With their “Zazou” look (inspired by Parisian paleo-punks from the 1940s), they serve up festive, frantic music, an improbable futuristic and melodious Charleston fit for the dance floor. Caravan Palace is to swing what the Gotan Project is to tango.

It so often starts out like that: a gang of mates who’ve kicked around together for the past ten years and who each get into music off their own bat. In this case, it was Hugues on the violin, Arnaud on guitar and Carlos on the double bass. A shared craze for manouche jazz (gypsy-style jazz), played in its natural setting, bars. Relatively serious composition, with a Zeitgeist twist: DIY electro, house, dub and hip-hop.

What triggered it all was an order placed by a film production company: a soundtrack for silent porn films dating from the beginning of the 20th century! They trotted out all their talents. Our three heroes played the end result to some friendly listeners, the feedback persuaded them to drop their individual projects and come up with a repertory of their own. Because there was no question for them of reworking Django or giving swing a face-lift! If they were going to forge their own path, it had to be something completely fresh.

This was back in 2005: it would take them an entire year. At which point they met Loïc Barrouk, manager of the Café de la Danse, who was really keen on the project. He got them into the studio (recording with session musicians), and then got them some gigs. For that, they needed some reliable fellow travellers, so they surfed MySpace. Two months later, the troops had been mustered: Chapi (clarinet), Toustou (who plays trombone and beat synthing), Aurélien (alternating as guitarist and DJ) and, last but not least, petulant vocalist Colotis Zoé, every bit as sweet’n’saucy as her signature song “Jolie coquine”! Among the three pioneers, Hugues, the crazy one, has revealed a talent for frenzied scat, Arnaud and Carlos double up their instruments thanks to programming. All together, they composed a new repertory. The Caravan took off.

Caravan Palace’s secret is a supersonic buzz on the Internet (free promo) and a year on the road with hard-hitting concerts, even before they released their record. A prime example was their performance at the 2007 Django Reinhardt Jazz Festival, in Samois, where they wowed an audience who had never heard of them. Veterans from the classic manouche jazz scene were left speechless. The excellent Caravan Palace musicians, who are of course “gadjos” (non-gypsies), have breathed fresh air into the timeless swing scene without coming across as preachers. As well as listeners with curious ears, the Caravan also has its own following, a horde of fans totally into the electro vibe, who turn up at each of their concerts. Caravan Palace’s reputation has rippled beyond the frontiers too, with Europe eager to check them out.

The album has at last been set for release in October 2008, on the Wagram label. With Caravan Palace, the future of swing looks set to swing. Read more on Last.fm. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Forever surrounded by a sense of intrigue, the world soon cottoned on to the elusive yet enchanting musical powers of this otherworldly beast. The results are that, today, his shamanistic sonic powers take him all around the world...

Yet despite the best efforts of the hungry masses, the mysterious Claptone still remains a mythical, little known figure who slips in and out of the shadows, leaving in his wake lasting musical experiences. Since hatching in 2012, he has continued to send people into a frenzy with his DJ sets, which are underpinned by supple grooves from the house world, are coloured with real soul and can jack you up or zone you out depending on the mood.

To stay so private and unknown in the visual modern world of likes and photos is no mean feat, especially considering he plays more than 260 shows around the world each year. In 2017 he brought his own immersive and otherworldly 'The Masquerade' events with special guests including Black Coffee, Claude von Stroke, MK and Pete Tong all joining the fun to various places around the world. Besides appearing in Los Angeles, Rio, Berlin, Paris, New York and Barcelona, Claptone brought 'The Masquerade' back to Ibiza, with highlights including two all night long joint venture shows with Elrow at Amnesia. They saw him spellbind the audience for seven straight hours and were the first sold out shows of the year for the club.

Furthermore there were 'The Masquerade' stages hosted in Brazil, at Melt Festival, and in LA for Halloween, and Claptone also hosted an arena at the giant Tomorrowland where four million people tuned in to the live stream that saw him play with invited guests and friends. Because of his strong shamanistic powers, Claptone always leaves people lost in music, rather than concerned about who or what it is they see before them. For that reason he still remains proudly anonymous.

In terms of studio work in the last year, Claptone has served up plenty of stylish remixes of huge and influential artists like Depeche Mode, New Order, Disclosure, Faithless, Bastille and Hurts, all of which show how in demand he is by those who know. His remix of Gorillaz was picked as the best of a star studded selection, and his track The Drums saw endless BBC Radio 1 support. It was one of the tracks of the summer at festivals around the world as well as across Ibiza. All this lead to him being invited by the BBC to perform live to the whole UK during the legendary BBC R1 Ibiza Weekender, and comes off the back of Claptone winning Best House Artist for the 3rd year in a row at the Ibiza DJ Awards, and scoring the highest placed house DJ position in DJ Mag’s celebrated Top 100 DJs Poll (next to being the second highest ‘underground’ artist in the same poll, after Carl Cox).

2018 is sure to be just as busy for Claptone and rewarding for his fans, because it will bring with it ‘Fantast,’ a brand new and hugely anticipated album out in June, which sees Claptone dive deeper into his very own musical realm. With plenty of charismatic vocalists' help, the album is enchantingly beautiful, dreamy and at times naive in a liberating way. If you think you knew everything about Claptone let him prove you wrong.

To keep his now more than one million Facebook fans enthralled, Claptone appeases them with musical trails, such as his weekly Clapcast podcast, which is broadcast on more than 70 radio stations and has been downloaded more than six million times in just 2017 alone. He also allows them into a little corner of his ephemeral world by offering up his own self-designed magical t-shirts and masks, while continuing to win them over with musical offerings for club, radio and home streaming alike.

Davido was born in Atlanta GA, USA on November 21st to Mr And Mrs Adeleke and attended The British International School, Lagos. Travelling between the USA, the UK and Nigeria, Davido has experienced different cultures but still stays true to his roots and this is evident in his music and the people he considers his biggest influences musically, which include Don Jazzy, 2 Face idibia, Sound Sultan and Wande Coal. Though Davido started music professionally a year ago, he has been performing and making music since the age of 11. Now 18, he has set up a record label called HKN Music, jointly ownedby Davido and Ade, his older brother. The saying “If you want something done, do it yourself” is what led the brothers start the label as Davido believes that as a producer and recording artiste, he would be in the best position to create music that suits his style. When asked to choose an ideal producer to work with, he responded “...myself, because I knowwhat I want exactly!” He is however quick to mention that he would definitely be excited to work with Sarz, Jaysleek and/or Don Jazzy.
In a short space of time, Davido has developed a huge fan base (14 to 28-year-olds) in Nigeria, the US and the UK and the young fresh talent’s first  single “Back When” featuring Naeto C, is enjoying massive media attention and airplay online, on radio and TV. In his own words, his greatest reward so far is “having my family and friends support my dream. I can’t ask God for more”. Within no time Davido took us by storm when he released Dami Duro , which has been said to be one of Nigerians top hits ever made. Without a doubt, Dami Duro has become a leading club song as well as one of radios most played.
Without wasting much time, Davido and his management team, in collaboration with Clarence Peters, put together a first-class, never seen before type video, to back up the banger, Dami Duro. Not only did this video create major buzz around websites, TV stations and youtube, but was also said to be one of the best videos out of Nigeria. Without saying much, it is evident that Davido is one to watch out for in 2012! He is evidently here to stay, and deliver.
Davido had a very eventful Christmas (2011) season performing all over Nigeria. He had amazing performances at shows like the Kokoconcert, Rhythm Unplugged, Echo 2011, Access Bank End of year Party and the Sahara End of year concert
The Artiste
Davido admits that his love for entertaining people comes from his late mother who passed away in 2003. Losing his mother has been the most traumatic experience Davido has had to suffer but it has also been his inspiration as he states “...she’s the reason I do what I do.... she loved to entertain and I plan on carrying that legacy...”
With collaborations with artistes likeNaeto C, Shank, Lynxxx and popular UK artiste, Dotstar, Davido is set to prove to the music industry that he has what it takes to succeed. He has also shared stages with people like T-Pain, Fabulous, Keith Sweat, Cabo Snoop, D'Banj, Naeto C and more.
The Producer
As a versatile artiste, Davido is able to adapt to any beat produced by other producers. However, this is a craft he has succeeded in mastering and with help from his brother Ade, HKN Studios would be a force to reckon with in the Nigerian Music scene.
Often asked where his inspiration as a producer comes from, David explains “... I like it when people are happy and when they can dance to my music! My mom liked to dance to music and I am inspired when I think of the kind of beats that would make her dance”
His debut single “Back When” featuring Naeto C is a testament to Davido’s ability and skill as a producer. He has also produced music for ... Naeto C, Skales, Tiwa Savage and Sauce Kid. So, the next time you are dancing to a well made beat, pay attention because you might just hear “on the beat its Davido”... A signature that will be heard on chart-topping songs for a very long time!
The Student
Often considered playful and fun loving, Davido has shown that he is a focused individual and not allowing his music career get in the way of his education. Davido is currently studying Business Administrations in Babcock University and he is applying things he learns in school into running the business of his music career. Ensuring that a proper system and business tools are in place for his music career, Davido hasnot only built a recording studio for the HKN Records, he has also assembled a management and PR team to help him run his affairs while he focuses on his education. Music doesn’t take a back seat though... Davido runs on a very tight schedule to ensure that neither his music nor education suffers!
The Brand
Good talent is hard to go unnoticed. However, more profitable than good talent is a good brand. The Davido brand is increasing growing and commanding attention. The good quality of the debut single “Back When” featuring Naeto C, produced by Davido, is complimented by the quality of the video shot by Award Winning Video Director, Clarence Peters.
The “Back When” video has over 100,000 views on youtube and has had massive airplay on MTV, SoundCity, 1 Music Channel and all Terrestrial TV stations.
Davido is probably one of the busiestof the new artistes in Nigeria as he has performed in some of the biggest shows this year. These shows include
The Music Meets Runway Show
PSquare Invasion Concert
“This is Lynxxx” Campus Tour
Vivendi Fashion Show
Clan by Deola Sagoe
Loud on Sound Concert
Koko Concert London
Elite Model Look 2011 and many others
Rhythm Unplugged,
Echo 2011,
Access Bank End of year Party
The Sahara End of year concert.
With offers already coming his way for more appearances and performances, Davido’s fan base is set to go “off the roof”. Without a doubt, Davido will be vital to selling a few brands in the country.
As an artiste and a producer, Davido is focused on ensuring consistency in the quality of music he gives his fans that are increasing by the minute. Davido’s brand management team is looking forward to developing concepts and working with brands to establish mutually beneficial relationships.
Davido is managed by 21 year-old Asa Asika, who has worked with artists such as Sasha, Naeto C, YQ, GT The Guitarman, Ikechukwu, Pype and many more.
What’s Next?
Davido has been recording with artistes like Dotstar, Lynxxx, Sauce Kid, DJ Skales, Tiwa Savage, Mo’Cheddah, DJ Neptune, FlxeFit, Wizkid, Shank, and much more in preparation for his debut album, which is currently untitled. With the debut single entering countdown charts across the country, Davido is almost always set to release a follow up single to ensure that his fans always have something new to enjoy.
